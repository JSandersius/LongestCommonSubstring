build a tictac toe game 
built a minesweeper 


this is JAVA -> 
____________
class Queue { 
stack first= new Stack C>C); boolean de queued;  int temp; 
<integer>
Stack<integer> Sec = ... i 
public void enqueue (int i) }  //fast
first.push (i);
}

 
public int dequeue { 
if }



always going to be inserting into the first stack 



build intuition and then code it out --> 



getting problem --> knowing as many patterns as you can 

job is numbers game --
